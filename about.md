## Goals and Priorities

This site exists to provide accurate, relevant and helpful information and documentation about Scala.
The priorities are:

1. To serve Scala developers, with special focus on those still learning the language.
   Their experience is of great importance to the health of the Scala community and Scala's continued success.

2. To foster a community of contributors which focuses on achieving this site's first priority.
   Everything that makes contributing easier needs to be done, as long as it doesn't detract from the first priority.

3. There is no third priority.

## Contributions Welcome!

Contributions are welcome in all shapes and forms.

- Describing your experience using this site (or learning Scala in general) is a valuable contribution by itself.
- Voicing your opinion does not mean you are on the hook for also suggesting possible changes (or even implementing them).
- Criticism is encouraged, both good and bad. While it's nice to know which things are good,
  it is of even greater importance to know which parts are bad and require improvement.
  This helps to make sure effort is spent on those parts that can make the biggest difference.
- Opinions on what needs to be done can differ. You will not be attacked for disagreeing or pointing out problems.
- To raise issues, propose changes or offer contributions, start by creating a ticket in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/soc/scala-lang/issues).
  This allows us to coordinate, gain different point of views, provide guidance and makes sure work is not accidentally duplicated.
- Your time is valuable. If you provided a suggestion, but we feel that a different approach might be better,
  we will tell you as soon as possible, so you don't waste time or work on an approach that is unlikely to be included.
